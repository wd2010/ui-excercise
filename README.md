### Task: 

This application is a simple user interface for viewing a very large set of data with an arbitrary number of columns.

Your task is to improve the usability of the user interface within the limited time available.

1. Think about what changes are realistic within the time you have avaliable.
2. Think about or draw wireframes for improvements that you would apply if more time was available.
3. Think about what users may want to do with the data. Use case is left open intentionally. 
4. You are allowed to use any freely avaliable/open source libraries/css - but you will be expected to discuss the rationale for your changes.
5. You can change any part of the code.
5. Feel free to ask questions.

### Ideas of Dan
1. Use `react-list` or `react-virtualized` to mount the dom of visibility area and  reduce the size of dom.
2. Generate the data dynamically when scroll to bottom of the page;
3. Use server-side-render to reduce the time of blank page, because the dom `<div id="root"></div>` is empty;
4. Use http2 Server Push vendor chunk which it is large and other bussiness logic depends;
5. If all of the columns data are not relational, I will divide them into different components. So it will not affect other column when adding a column or reducing .

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
